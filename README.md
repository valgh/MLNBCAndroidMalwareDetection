# MLNBCAndroidMalwareDetection

First homework of ML course at Sapienza University of Rome, a.y. 2018/2019.
The ***DREBIN*** dataset is not publicly available, it must be requested, so it is not published in this repository.
You can request it here: https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/

The .pdf file reports the main ideas and results obtained - there are some typos here and there, sorry for that.
